# binary-search-tree

This is my implementation of a Binary Search Tree for The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees#project-solution).

A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that consists of nodes organized in a specific manner. At the 'top' of the tree sit's the root node. To the right or left of that node, sits another, and so forth. Each node to the right will have a greater value than their root, and each to the left, a lesser.

Below is an example of a tree consisiting of 30 values.

This was created using javascript and recursive function calls, as seen below in the buildTree function, which recursively call's itself.
